# 7CS080_Database_Design
University of Wolverhampton Database &amp; Security Module

This module taught me database knowledge such as the data modelling, the relational model, SQL, normalisation, transactions, security and ethics aspects.

I also learned how to model and implement a real-world problem, to create a system that is capable to satisfy your users' information needs.

This was built using OracleDB via SQLplus with an entity relationship model designed before implementation.
